## The Story
They found you lying in the meadow near the mountain pass.
Dischevelled, dirty, and unconcious.
Your charred garments were like nothing they'd ever seen before.
When you finally awoke in the village, you couldn't tell them your name, or where you'd come from.
Your life was a blur. Your only memory was of falling.
They gave you the name Gilbert.
Lord Bennett took pity on you and welcomed you into the village.
You quickly became a valued member of the community, working hard and providing fascinating innovations, such as new farming tools.
Many suspected you had been a scholar in your prior life, given the lack of wear and tear on your body, and your ability to learn quickly.
Over time you have become quite close to Lady Jocosa, the daughter of Lord Bennett.
Your thoughts turn to marriage. Perhaps today will be the day you work up the courage to propose.
Meanwhile, the mystery of your past continues to haunt you. From what strange place did you come? And will you ever remember it?
